## Build

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2015 / 2017 / 2019 / 2022
- [Windows Driver Kit 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

### Build Steps
1. Open `VmLoader.sln` with Visual Studio
2. Build VmLoader as **x64/Release** (x86 is not supported)
3. Test-sign `bin/vmloader.sys` for test-sign mode:
   ```cmd
   signtool sign /f your_test_cert.pfx /p password /t http://timestamp.digicert.com bin/vmloader.sys
   ```

# Installation

## Critical Warning

**DO NOT INSTALL VMWARE TOOLS!** It will expose VM presence through multiple channels.

Use remote access alternatives:
- TeamViewer
- AnyDesk  
- Windows Remote Desktop (mstsc)
- VNC viewer
- Chrome Remote Desktop

## 1st Step: Add following settings into .vmx

**Essential VMX Configuration** - Add these settings to your `.vmx` file:

### Basic Hypervisor Hiding
```
hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = "FALSE"
board-id.reflectHost = "TRUE"
hw.model.reflectHost = "TRUE"
serialNumber.reflectHost = "TRUE"
smbios.reflectHost = "TRUE"
SMBIOS.noOEMStrings = "TRUE"
```

### Backdoor Communication Blocking
```
isolation.tools.getPtrLocation.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.setPtrLocation.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.setVersion.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.getVersion.disable = "TRUE"
monitor_control.restrict_backdoor = "TRUE"
```

### VMware Tools Features (Disable All)
```
isolation.tools.ghi.autologon.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.hgfs.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.memSchedFakeSampleStats.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.getCreds.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.ghi.trayicon.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.unity.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.unityInterlockOperation.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.unity.push.update.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.unity.taskbar.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.unityActive.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.vmxDnDVersionGet.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.guestDnDVersionSet.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.dnd.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.copy.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.paste.disable = "TRUE"
```

### Timing Normalization
```
monitor_control.disable_directexec = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_chksimd = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_ntreloc = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_selfmod = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_reloc = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btinout = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btmemspace = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btpriv = "TRUE"
monitor_control.disable_btseg = "TRUE"
```

### Virtual RDTSC (Optional but Recommended)
```
monitor_control.virtual_rdtsc = "TRUE"
monitor_control.virtual_rdtsc_offset = "0"
```

### Disk Configuration (SCSI)

If you have a SCSI virtual disk at scsi0 slot (first slot) as your system drive:

```
scsi0:0.productID = "Samsung SSD 860"
scsi0:0.vendorID = "Samsung"
```

Example configuration:
```
scsi0:0.productID = "SSD 860 EVO"
scsi0:0.vendorID = "Samsung"
```

## 2nd Step: Modify MAC address

Change the guest's MAC address to avoid VMware OUI detection:

**Avoid these VMware OUIs:**
```
00:05:69  # VMware, Inc.
00:0C:29  # VMware, Inc.
00:1C:14  # VMware, Inc.
00:50:56  # VMware, Inc.
```

**Recommended approach** - Add to `.vmx` file:
```
ethernet0.address = "00:1B:21:XX:XX:XX"  # Intel OUI
```

Or use other common manufacturer OUIs:
```
00:1B:21  # Intel Corporate
00:50:B6  # Dell
B8:27:EB  # Raspberry Pi (less suspicious in labs)
```

Example:
```
ethernet0.address = "00:1B:21:3A:4F:C2"
ethernet0.addressType = "static"
```

## 3rd Step: Run install.bat in VM guest

1. Copy `bin/vmloader.sys` to your VM guest
2. Run `install.bat` as **Administrator**
3. Check output:
   - If errors occur, use [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) to capture kernel debug output
   - Post issues with DebugView output and your `ntoskrnl.exe` if needed
4. If no errors, the driver is successfully loaded!

## Verification

After installation, you can verify the driver is working by:

1. **Check DbgView output** - Look for initialization messages:
   ```
   [VmLoader] Windows Build: 22000
   [VmLoader] Operating System: Windows 11
   [VmLoader] [OK] CPUID Masking initialized
   [VmLoader] [OK] Timing Normalization initialized
   ...
   [VmLoader] VmLoader initialized successfully!
   [VmLoader] Active modules: 10/10
   ```

2. **Run detection tools**:
   - VMProtect 3.x packed executables (anti-vm enabled)
   - Pafish
   - Al-Khaser
   - Custom CPUID/timing checks

## Showcase

- ✅ Manual: Requires manual configuration
- 🔶 Framework: Infrastructure ready for future implementation

## Technical Notes

### Limitations

Some anti-detection features require hypervisor-level capabilities:

1. **Direct CPUID Interception**: Requires VT-x EPT hooking or exception handlers
2. **RDTSC/RDTSCP Interception**: Requires hypervisor or CPU microcode-level access
3. **I/O Port Filtering**: Requires hypervisor I/O bitmap configuration
4. **MSR Interception**: Requires hypervisor MSR bitmap configuration

**Current Approach**: The driver provides comprehensive detection, analysis, and VMX configuration guidance. Combined with proper VMX settings, this creates an effective multi-layer defense.

**Future Enhancement**: Could be extended with:
- Hypervisor-based interception (Type-1 thin hypervisor)
- Binary patching of detection code (more invasive)
- Memory scanning and patching of known detection patterns

### Windows 11 Compatibility

The modernized driver fully supports Windows 11:
- Build detection (22000+)
- Compatible with VBS (Virtualization-Based Security)
- Aware of KDP (Kernel Data Protection)
- Updated kernel structure offsets
- Works with Secure Boot in test-signing mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Driver fails to load
- **Solution**: Ensure test-signing is enabled: `bcdedit /set testsigning on`
- Reboot after enabling test-signing
- Verify driver is properly signed

**Issue**: Detection still occurs
- **Solution**: Verify ALL VMX settings are applied
- Ensure VMware Tools is NOT installed
- Check MAC address is not using VMware OUI
- Review DbgView output for module initialization status

**Issue**: System crash or BSOD
- **Solution**: Incompatible Windows version or kernel structure mismatch
- Check DbgView output before crash
- Report issue with Windows version and ntoskrnl.exe

**Issue**: "ExpFirmwareTableResource not found" error
- **Solution**: Kernel structure offsets may have changed
- Report Windows build number and ntoskrnl.exe for analysis
